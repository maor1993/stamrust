# Stamrust - HTTP server demo 
an implmentation of CDC-NCM, HTTP, DHCP, all in rust!

inspired by: https://github.com/IntergatedCircuits/IPoverUSB

# Building
the project builds for the [stamdev board](https://www.tindie.com/products/maorm7/stamdev-l412/), which uses stm32l412 128K FLASH, 40K RAM.

# Use
one built and burnt, you should be able to connect to `192.168.69.1` on your webbrowser.

here you can control the RGB led on the board, and also see the number of program loops performed per second
